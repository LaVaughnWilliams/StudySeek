# StudySeek
Students waste valuable time searching for good study spaces on campus. This issue mainly affects college students who need focused and productive environments for studying or completing assignments.

Current solutions, like campus maps or room schedules, need to give more information and focus only on availability without considering outside factors like noise or crowd size. These tools need help to address the diverse needs of students who prefer quieter, less crowded, or more conveniently located spaces. Not only does this cause a dip in students' grades It also tanks their motivation to work because their mindset tends to fall into a state of “if there’s no space to study, why study at all?”.

Thats where StudySeek comes in!
